The libraries using in this project are: os, pandas, numpy and matplotlib and they are already installed in Anaconda 3.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using A Kaggle dataset focusing on the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA 2016. I will find the answer for three questions below:

1. How are the hosts in Seattle in 2016?
2. How is the business of hosts in Seattle in 2016?
3. What makes a host more attractive to tenants?

The data and their visualization I have created show the overview picture of the Airbnb's business in Seattle 2016 and find some special view of this business. 
By the way when build this project I have learned  and trained lots of things about data analytic and make a good business sence of tourism.
