I want to get into the data industry when I started my own business and realized the importance of making decisions based on the customer data I gathered. 
In this project, I use python with libraries: pandas, numpy and matplotlib for data processing and analysis. 
This file contain four path: README.md, data files, my notebook to processing data and my blog about the topic: Seattle Airbnb booking business in 2016.
They shows how I processing data with csv file and use pandas, numpy and matplotlib, creat some charts to visualize data and give some opinion about them.
